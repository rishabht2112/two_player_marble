Two player marble game

1. Board Layout:
  • The game board is a 4x4 grid of cells.
  • The board is conceptually divided into two areas: an inner and an outer region.
2. Game Flow:
  • The game is played between two players, each with a set of marbles.
  • Players take turns placing their marbles on an empty cell of their choice within the grid.
  • On each turn, every marble on the board (both players') moves one cell counterclockwise.
3. Objective:
  • The first player to align four of their marbles consecutively—either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—wins the game.
